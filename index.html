  <h2>Self Introduction</h2>
  <h3>School Life</h3>

  <p>
    I was in <a href="https://tcgs.tc.edu.tw/">Taichung Girl's High School</a>, and now I'm currently in the <a href="https://web.ee.ntu.edu.tw/">Department of Electrical Engineering of National Taiwan University</a>. I've been enthusiastic about science and mathematics since I was little, though ironically, the subjects in which I'm the best at are English and Chinese.

      Sometimes when studying, I get exhausted as well as frustrated after merely half an hour. Nonetheless, things are entirely different when it comes to drawing<a href="https://www.instagram.com/marijatiurina/"></a>. I can immerse myself in all the lines and colors for numorous hours, before I'm finally satisfied with the picture.
      In my opinion, I'm the best at line arts, especially when it comes to drawing flowers. However, I recently draw more colorful pictures, either due to the tasks that I was assigned, or simply because I wanted to paint something with my iPad. I've never drawn most of the items, so I could hardly imagine how the pictures will eventually look. Luckily, most of the results turned out to be great -- at least in my eyes.

      When I was a seventh grader, I saw a classmate playing a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JPerm">Rubik's cube</a>. It sparkled my curiosity, and immediately bought one then googled how to play it. It took me 6 hours to solve the cube for the first time, but the sense of achievement after completing was beyond my words.
      Later, I gradually picked up speed, yet I've never been qualified to call myself a "speed cuber." I enjoy more about playing different variations of 3x3x3 cubes, since I don't have to develop new algorithms, but they're still difficult (and fun as well) to solve. I coded two Rubik's cube simulators, first in high school with C++ console as its interface, and later in college with Processing, which makes the GUI possible for me.

      I started watching YouTube since I was in elementary school. I enjoyed Minecraft videos produced by several Taiwanese YouTubers. Upon entering junior high school, I switched to those recorded by American or British YouTubers to improve my English listening. I could barely comprehend what they said at first, but now I no longer struggle to understand English contents.
      One of my favorite YouTubers is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/MumboJumboOfficial">Mumbo Jumbo</a>. He's expert in redstone, but his videos are anything but technical and dull. Rather, his jokes always make me burst out laughter. In addition to his conpetence in redstone and humor, he's also turning into an eminent builder. He was once scared to deal with building, but now he's often "chuffed to bits" with his creations.
